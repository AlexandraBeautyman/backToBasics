the technical screening is very similar to the same thing at Fullstack. they don't give the problem in advance. one thing that threw him off was they teach a lot more direct DOM manipulation than at Fullstack. definitely study direct DOM manipulation. adding event listeners on a button. there are some things that you might not be familiar with because you haven't done them with straight javascript, but you do have a lot of experience with debugging.

server was just coming from a json file in their code. it's called json server. full fake rest api. just for testing purposes. run the command json server, put the name of the file, you can do post requests and everything. worth messing around with ahead of time. check out the github, use it once.

the test is a lab, frontend development. javascript. it's a form and we have to figure out why the form is not working.

prep: build myself a super one-page project with just the basics. skip react and redux. index.html with a form. index.js file that sends request to a little json server. use fetch instead of axios. and .then instead of async await.

One last point for the mini vanilla JS project, use the built in Fetch API instead of a package like Axios, and try promise chaining in .then's instead of async/await üëç https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API
that's another thing that definitely threw me through a loop because I had only ever done async/await with Axios and never used just regular old fetch().then()

I'd definitely suggest sticking to the OG first.. document.getElementById and such.
